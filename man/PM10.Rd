Air pollution data
}
\description{
The data are a subsample of 500 observations from a data set that originates in a study where air pollution at a road is related to traffic volume and meteorological variables, collected by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. The response variable consists of hourly values of the logarithm of the concentration of PM10 (particles), measured at Alnabru in Oslo, Norway, between October 2001 and August 2003. (Source)
